__| Version 5.0 - 2012-12-31 |__________________________________________________

 This is the *final* version of Selfboot Inducer 5.0, after many tests, the
 application is now very stable.
 
 I know that releasing this application in 2012 is too late, many of people
 use the excellent SD card adapter, but like I said before, I started this
 project back in 2008 and I'm happy to finish the work... 

 The complete source code's released with the program. It includes a new
 version of the MRImage.pas class to handle .MR logo files, written for 
 Delphi XE2, a very modern Delphi environment.
  
 Merry X-mas '12 and Happy New Year '13 to everyone !
 
- Fixed: Some minor modifications
- Fixed: Code cleanup
- Added: Complete source code
- Fixed: CD-RW drives detection (with the help of VasiliyRS)
- Fixed: Correct encoding for the generated batches (with the help of VasiliyRS)

__| Version 5.0 *BETA 2* - 2012-10-21 |_________________________________________                                                           

- Fixed: The MR code decompression bug was fixed, so the feature is now
  available! It supports every MR files created by third party tools and legit
  MR files too, included Windows CE or bleem! ones.
- Added: The Packages List scanner is now multi-threaded, so the ".\packages"
  directory scanning is much faster and don't hang the main window.
- Fixed: The "Select all" and "Unselect all" buttons will check/uncheck all
  packages in the selected filter view (in clear: if you filter your packages
  list with "Games", using "Unselect all" will unselect every "Games" packages,
  instead of unchecking ALL packages).

__| Version 5.0 *BETA 1* - 2012-09-16 |_________________________________________                                                           

 This is a complete rewrite of the program; the only thing common with the old
 v4.3 is... the name of the program. All features of the previous version has
 been made for this first public release. The programmation language was 
 switched from BCX (the free Basic To C compiler) to the Delphi XE2 environment.
 
 This version is labeled *BETA 1* because a last minute bug was discovered in 
 the MR code decompression, so the Bootstrap (IP.BIN) logo feature was 
 disabled.
 
- Added: Packages File List Selection:
  - The file list display now the information of the SBI package, the 
    package name (instead of the file name), the screenshot, the in-menu 
    description and of course, the "comment" package, which helps you to use 
    it.
  - You can filter the package list by selecting the proper package kind
    (Apps, Demos, Emus or Games).
  - A "Browse" button, allowing you to open the "packages" directory faster
  - A right-click pop-up menu on the files list, allow you to "Locate on Disk"
      the selected package.
- Added: The application is fully compatible with Windows 7; including x64 
  version (untested).
- Added: Burning / Image Generation process:
  - Possibility to generate Alcohol 120% images
  - For each image creation method (including burning with CDRecord) you can 
    choose for Audio/Data or Data/Data structure format. The Data/Data method
    is more newer and should work on every Dreamcast made (Audio/Data may not 
    work on the lastest produced Dreamcast).
  - CDRecord : More easier process (like BootDreams).
  - When you click on an image generation / burning panel, a simple help is
    available on the left (explaning how to use the feature; for example why
    choosing Audio/Data or Data/Data format!).
- Added: Configuration Dialog :
  - Auto-Dummy function (for 700MB CD-R... who's using 650MB CD-R in 2012 ?!)
    The dummy file is named "0.0" and will be hidden from the filesystem.
  - You can hide the Bootstrap file (IP.BIN) from the filesystem.
  - Possibility to choose a boostrap logo (iplogo.mr before); this feature is
    currently disabled because a bug was found, it will be available in the
    final release of Selfboot Inducer 5.
- Added: Main Toolbar:
  - An exit button (the big cross in the bottom-right corner).
  - An help button.
  - Icons are now 48x48 high-resolution.
  - New group buttons (the "Make Disc" and "Trash" buttons are in the same
    group, since they control disc preparation; before the "Trash" button was
    in the bottom-right corner of the window).
- Added: If you exit the application and it still working, a confirmation is
  shown... it can be useful if you burn under CDRecord!
- Fixed: New disc generation process, the code is more efficient and powerful.
- Updated: Embedded tutorial; original by Curtiss Grymala
- Updated: The state of the window and every option is now saved in a 
  configuration file.
- Updated: CDRTools package updated (v3.01a07-i686-pc-mingw32); no 
  "cygwin1.dll" POSIX-emulator needed anymore.
- Updated: New program icon...
- Updated: A new about box dialog
