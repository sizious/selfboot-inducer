  Selfboot Inducer 5 is a Windows program made to build a DreamInducer bootable 
  compilation CD-ROM for your Sega Dreamcast.

  DreamInducer is a Dreamcast program made by DCGrendel allowing you to put 
  multiple homebrew games, emulators, demos or applications onto the same CD. 
  For the history, it was submitted as an entry for the DCEmulation's 
  Programming Contest 2002 Edition.
  
  To use this application, you must have the packages corresponding to the
  application you like, for example "neo4all.sbi" for Neo 4 All emulator from
  our friend Chui. SBI packages can be found on the net. 
  
  If you can't find SBI package, remember that you can use the "SBI Builder" 
  application to build your proper package!

  You can remplace the "Sb!ffy" default theme by your theme, for this, just
  put the "(theme_name).sbt" file in the "packages" directory. Currently, there
  isn't programs to make Selfboot Inducer Themes.

  This application was written by [big_fury]SiZiOUS; just call me "SiZiOUS" or
  "SiZ!". The "big_fury" prefix is my (very) older nickname, the first I taken,
  it's a reference of the "Big Fury Monster" card from Magic The Gathering 
  Ungled Edition.
